# amala-atlas-hackathon
A collaboration on the project - "Amala Atlas" - we named it 'AMA' tentatively along with my team - The Amala Cartographer 
The Amala Cartographers: Amala Atlas
Project Vision
Amala Atlas is a crowdsourced, global map dedicated to discovering and verifying authentic Amala spots. Our mission is to make finding this beloved Nigerian delicacy easy for everyone, everywhere. We're building a community-driven platform that will use agentic intelligence to automatically discover potential locations from the web and a user-friendly map to allow our community to add and verify these spots.
Our goal is to deliver a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the "Amala" Hackathon and lay the foundation for a scalable, open-source project.
