Àmàlàmi

Project Description

Àmàlàmi is a community-driven web application designed to help users discover and share the best Àmàlà spots in their city. Built as a single-page application, the platform serves as a digital map and review guide, empowering Àmàlà lovers to crowdsource locations and insights. Our MVP focuses on a seamless user experience, from authentication to content creation, leveraging the power of modern web technologies and generative AI.

Core Features (MVP)

User Authentication: Users can access the app and contribute as either an Authenticated User (signed in) or a Guest User (anonymous login).

Spot Submission: Authenticated users can easily add new Àmàlà spots to the public database by providing the spot's name, address, and an optional description.

Crowdsourced Map: All submitted spots are displayed in a dynamic "map" view, allowing the entire community to see and explore new locations in real-time.

Gemini API Integration: We integrated the Gemini API to power several innovative features:

AI-Powered Descriptions: Automatically generate creative descriptions for a new spot based on its name.

Image Analysis: Describe uploaded images to help users provide more context for their spot.

Review Summarization: Summarize multiple user reviews into a single, concise paragraph to provide quick insights for visitors.

Conversational Assistant: A chat assistant helps users navigate the app and provides information about finding Àmàlà spots.

Text-to-Speech: A text-to-speech function welcomes users to the app, adding an auditory layer to the user experience.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (ES6+)

Backend as a Service: Firebase (Authentication and Firestore Database)

Generative AI: Google Gemini API

How to Run

This project is a single-page application and does not require a complex build process. Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to run the application.

Future Enhancements

Review and Rating System: Implement a full-featured review system where users can submit ratings and comments for each spot.

Geolocation: Use the browser's geolocation API to automatically suggest a user's current location when adding a new spot.

Image Uploads: Allow users to upload images of Àmàlà spots to the database for more comprehensive listings.

Search and Filters: Add functionality to search and filter spots by criteria such as rating, location, and price range.

Admin Dashboard: Create a separate admin interface for managing, approving, or removing submitted spots and reviews.
